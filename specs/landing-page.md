Based on user feedback and common questions.

**Q: Is this a cryptocurrency? Can I buy coins?**
**A:** No. "Coins" are simply community points used to ensure the system is fair. They have no monetary value and cannot be bought or sold. The only way to earn coins is by helping others (uploading vouchers).

**Q: Why do you use Telegram instead of WhatsApp?**
**A:** WhatsApp charges fees for automated messages, whereas Telegram is free. Using Telegram allows us to keep this service 100% free for everyone forever.

**Q: Can I use online or app vouchers?**
**A:** Yes! You can upload screenshots of vouchers from the Dunnes Stores app or from your email. They work exactly the same as paper vouchers.
